## Core Features:

- Ticket Generation & Public Display: Allows students to generate a queue ticket for counters or cashier, with real-time public displays showing current ticket numbers and waiting status for each station.
- Staff Counter Management: An interface for counter staff to call the next student, mark tickets as served, and set their counter status (open/closed).
- Staff Cashier Management: An interface for the cashier to call the next student, mark tickets as served, and set their cashier status (open/closed).
- Flexible Station Assignment (Combo Mode): An administrative tool to dynamically reassign a counter or the cashier to handle multiple queue types, allowing for 'all-in-one' or 'combo' operational modes based on staffing and queue demands.
- Real-time Queue Updates: Ensures that all public displays and staff interfaces instantly reflect changes in queue status, ticket calls, and station availability.
- Queue Data Persistence: Securely stores all active and completed queue tickets, station configurations, and historical queue data for system reliability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, professional blue (#2D5CB3) to convey trust and efficiency, inspired by maritime and educational professionalism.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue-grey (#E6EDF7) providing a clean and readable backdrop, complementing the primary color.
- Accent color: A bright and clear aqua (#20C5DB) to highlight urgent information or interactive elements, ensuring good contrast and visibility.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its neutral, modern, and highly legible characteristics, suitable for displaying numbers and critical information clearly.
- Use clear, universally recognizable icons (e.g., play, stop, checkmark) for quick understanding of queue actions and statuses.
- Employ a structured, modular layout with clear separation between queue types and stations, ensuring easy readability at a distance for public displays and intuitive navigation for staff interfaces.
- Implement subtle animations, such as gentle fades or slides, for queue number updates or status changes to provide clear visual feedback without distracting users.
